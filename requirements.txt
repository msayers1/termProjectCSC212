Breakdown

  Groups of 3-4 students
    Groups of size 4 will be expected to produce more

  Deliverables include:
    source code submitted (GitHub)
    class presentation (Gradescope/Zoom)
    project report (Gradescope)

Source Code (20%)

  Code Repository must be created on GitHub
    this will be considered as your submission (no need to upload source code to gradescope)
    individual contributions must be clear on the repo

  Code Organization (graded)
    use of classes and functions encouraged
    proper indentation
    use of comments

  TAs may be asked to compile your code locally (graded)
    must create a markdown README in your GitHub repo with instructions on dependencies and how to compile your code
    if project is incomplete, partial credit may be given after TAs analyze your code

Presentation (40%)
  Team will present for 15 minutes to the class (Zoom)
    explain the data structure/algorithm your team is focusing on (8 min)
    show your source code (running) and findings (plots) (4 min)
    answer questions (3)
    
  Partial credit may be given if the project is incomplete but students
    show a very good understanding of the data structure/algorithm
  Submit the PDF of your presentation to Gradescope
  % of your presentation grade will come from observing other groupâ€™s presentation

Project Report (40%)
  Report must include:
    title of project
    names of all team members
    introduction (explain the context and purpose of your project)
    methods (explain the data structure/algorithm with more details)
    implementation (describe your work, include plots or figures if necessary)
    contributions (describe precisely what each member contributed to the project)
  Partial credit may be given if the project is incomplete but the report includes relevant information regarding your progress
   
  Submit the PDF of your report to Gradescope
  
  
Topic: Trie

  Implement the Data Structure (using classes)
  Must store the words of an input text file
    for the word (node) in the tree, a count with the number of repeats muct also be stored
  Ensure at least insert/serach methods are correctly implemented
    search must also return/show the count
  Generate a DOT file for visualization

Text for Report:
  Linda - Introduction,
  Mike - Implementation
  Each Member will work on the function they worked on for the Member description.
